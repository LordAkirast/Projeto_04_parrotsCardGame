# Projeto_04_parrotsCardGame
The fourth project during the Full Stack Developer course by Driven.
I started to code using what I knew. The objective was to make a memory game using only Javascript. 
The first version was effective but not the best way to do it. I learned that after I started to use arrays to put the cards on the screen.
Before that, I used IF and ELSE and it wasn't the ideal way.
After I learnt how to use arrays, I decided to start all over the JavaScript part and created it from beggining. 
Now the game is over, but... it isn't a memory game. It is more of a lucky game. Because, if you fail, you'll need to start over.
If you fail, cards will not flip back to their default state. Reason: I don't know how to do it. 
I couldn't achieve my objective that was to create a memory game. So... I decided to change things a little bit and created a luck card game.
